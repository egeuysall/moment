## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously and encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please follow the steps below to report it:

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1. **Do not create a public issue** for the security vulnerability.
2. **Email** us directly at `contact@egeuysal.com` with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable).
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or other information that can help us understand the issue.
3. **Subject line**: Use a clear subject like "Security Vulnerability Report - [brief description of issue]".

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours of receiving it.
- **Response Time**: We aim to review and assess reported vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. If necessary, we will follow up for further details.
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depending on the severity and complexity of the vulnerability, we will provide an estimated timeline for a fix or patch. For critical vulnerabilities, we will prioritize a swift resolution.

### Vulnerability Accepted or Declined

- **If the vulnerability is accepted**, we will work on creating a fix and release it in the next patch or security update.
- **If the vulnerability is declined**, we will provide feedback on why the issue does not meet our security criteria, and we may offer suggestions or guidance on how to mitigate the concern in your specific use case.

### Confidentiality

All vulnerability reports are handled confidentially. We request that you do not disclose any vulnerability publicly until we have released a fix or addressed the issue in a public update.

### Acknowledging Contributors

If the vulnerability is accepted and fixed, we will acknowledge the contributor who reported the issue in the release notes (if appropriate), unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

We are committed to keeping this project secure. Security updates will be released as soon as possible once a vulnerability is confirmed and resolved. To stay informed about new security patches, please check the **Release Notes** and watch for notifications on the repository.
